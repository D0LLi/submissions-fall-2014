 "<h1> Why? </h1>"

 "&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBelow is the data for the past five National Basketball Association (<b>NBA</b>) championship team seasons."
 "Included are the teams' average statitics for the year as well as their Final opponent average statistics.
 We chose this data in order to answer the question: what makes up a championship team?
 We will compare the season averages of the winning team and the runner-up and see why one team won and why the other lost.
