Getting the same error over and over again "Template Not Found" for the Home.html page. It appears that it's all in the right place, so I can't figure out why it's being ridiculous. This is Anya's part of the code that she most recently changed, so until we can get in contact I can't finish the Pure part of the project. Will definitely have this updated and working by tomorrow evening.
