  <h3> Background Information: </h3>We chose to analyze basketball players because we thought it <br> would be interesting to compare the best players to <br>ever play the sport with each other. At first we were comparing the <br>Player Efficiency Rating and the regular stat line of the players, <br>but we realized that there would be no way to compare them. So we <br>just tried to determine who was the greatest player of all time (G.O.A.T). <br>
