<h3> Conclusion: </h3>After we had finished with our code, we saw that the results of our <br>project generally created the same ranking order of the People's <br>Choice Ranking order. However, there were exceptions. For example, <br>Bill Russell, who was ranked by the People's Choice Ranking as the <br>3rd best player of all time. However, after factoring in the Career <br>Efficiency Value, Bill Russell ended up as 27th on our modified list. <br>His Efficiency ranking was 67, far from his People's Choice Ranking. <br>The Efficiency is a composite basketball statistic that theoretically <br>shows how good the player is. However, this rating is criticized for <br>not fairly weighing the defensive contribution as much as the <br>offensive contribution of a player. Bill Russell has been regarded as <br>the greatest defensive player in the history of the NBA, so our <br>results have supported the criticism of the unbalance of offensive <br>and defensive contributions of the player. Eventually, the NBA might <br>be able to come up with a better way to produce a ranking system. <br><br>
