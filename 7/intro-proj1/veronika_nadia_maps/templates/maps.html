 <b><u><font size="4" face="impact"> <h1 align="center"> 311 calls of New York in 2013</h1></font></u></b>
<center>These are a bunch of maps displaying some 311 complaints during 2013 before May. I used the function of the google maps that lets you put info directly in a url to generate an image. The first few maps were some I found interesting, and the ones after that were all too big for one image, so I isolated the data from that April, and then split up the calls by borough. (Sidenote: sometimes there's a weird error image in place of the map, if you're really curious and/or dedicated, the url is usally valid and can be opened in a new page.) </center>


{% for item in html_list %}
{% if loop.index is odd  %}
 <center><h4> {{item}} </h4> </center>
{% else %}
 <center> <img src='{{item}}'alt=image> </center>
{%endif%}
{%endfor%}

{% for item in html_list_two %}
{% if (loop.index-1) is divisibleby 6 %}
 <center><h4> {{item}} </h4></center>
{% else %}
 <center> <img src='{{item}}'alt=image> </center>
{%endif%}
{%endfor%}


<center>As you can see, there isn't often that much correlation, except for Decorative Necklace Lighting.
I mean, something must have gone down near the Brooklyn Bridge.However, the maps are still pretty interesting.</center>
