    <h1>About our project</h1>
	Justin Strauss and Derek Tsui <br>
	Software Development Period 7 <br>
	MongoDB Project <br>
 <br>
	The project is an account manager with the following pages: <br>
 <br>
	1. A login page - /login <br>
	2. A logout page <br>
	3. A register page - /register <br>
	4. At least one page that can be viewed without logging in - /index <br>
	5. At least 2 pages that can only be viewed if you are logged in. - /profile and /contacts <br>
 <br>
	All pages should indicate if you're logged in or not by displaying either the username or a link to the login page. <br>
 <br>
	If you go to a protected page and you're not logged in, it should redirect you to the login page. Once you log in (or register / login) it should redirect you back to the protected page. <br>
 <br>
	It would be nice if one of the protected pages is a change account specifics page. You might also want to track things like last login or logout or something like that. <br>
 <br>
	Things you'll need in addition to basic flask stuff: <br>
 <br>
	1. Mongo to store the accounts -- username and password is a minimum but you might want to track other info. <br>
	2. Sessions - to keep track of your state. <br>
	3. You might want to look at flash/flashing in the flask docs - it'll make it easy to do things like displaying one time error messages like invalid password. <br>
