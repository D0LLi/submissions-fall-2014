This is a test file for our regular expression Software Development project. Since Software Development is the name of a course, it is capitalized and may be picked up by the namefinder even though it isn't the name of a person. We will first use regular expressions to find all of the words that are possibly people’s names. This will pick up places, like San Francisco, which will later need to be weeded out. To do this, we will use a census database to compare the “candidates” to known first and last names. We can look no further than the staff of the Stuyvesant High School computer science department for examples of names that make cause our program trouble. For example, Mr. JonAlf Dyrland-Weaver and Mr. Topher Brown Mykolyk both have first and last names that aren’t included in the census database. On the other hand, super common names like John Smith and Sophia Brown should work.
